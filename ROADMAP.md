# Isula OS Roadmap

This document serves to provide a long term roadmap for our lovely Isula OS.
Its goal is to help both maintainers and contributors find meaningful tasks to focus on and create a low noise environment.
The items in the 1.0 roadmap can be broken down into smaller milestones that are easy to accomplish.

## Release the workable OS
We plan to have a first stable release at the end of 2017.12.31.
Just like Ubuntu, we ship it like this:  Isula-17.04, Isula-17.10.

Still, we will continue to release 18.04 and 18.10 in 2018.

## Add one or more incubate projects
